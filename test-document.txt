Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to process data.

Key applications of AI include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Expert Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles

The future of AI holds promise for solving complex problems in healthcare, climate change, and scientific research.

Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information. They can recognize patterns in data and make predictions based on training examples.

Computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, including object detection, image classification, and facial recognition.

Natural language processing allows computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way. This includes tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interactions.
